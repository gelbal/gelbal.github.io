# About

Hello, there! My name is FÄ±rat Gelbal. On this website you see my works and writings. I enjoy doing data analysis, data visualization, storytelling and traveling, among many more things.


Currently, I work at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) as Analytics Engineer. We are passionate about making the web a better place. Luckily Scattered lets me work remotely. That helps with travelling and living in different parts of the world. Nowadays I'm positioned in Spain and Turkey.


Feel free to [email me](mailto:firat.gelbal@gmail.com) to say 'hi' or ask questions. My open source projects are listed on [GitHub](http://github.com/gelbal/). Find out more about me from the below links.
