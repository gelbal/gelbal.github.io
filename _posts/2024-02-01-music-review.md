Music has always been an integral part of the creative process, providing both inspiration and focus during long coding sessions and writing marathons.

## Recent Discoveries

This month I've been exploring the intersection of ambient electronic music and productivity. Artists like Brian Eno, William Basinski, and Stars of the Lid have created soundscapes that enhance concentration without becoming distracting.

### Key Albums

- **Discreet Music** by Brian Eno - The pioneering work that defined ambient music
- **The Disintegration Loops** by William Basinski - Meditative decay and transformation
- **And Their Refinement of the Decline** by Stars of the Lid - Orchestral ambient perfection

These works demonstrate how music can create space for thought while remaining unobtrusive enough to allow for deep focus.
