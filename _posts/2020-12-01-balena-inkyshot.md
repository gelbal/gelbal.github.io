At [balena](https://www.balena.io) we developed [open source software and hardware](https://github.com/balena-io-experimental/inkyshot): e-ink screen connected Raspberry Pi that reads quotes and weather forecast online and displays on screen. I built the weather API integration and weather icon display.
