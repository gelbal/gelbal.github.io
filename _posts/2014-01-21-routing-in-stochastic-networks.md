> Nothing at all of this is fixed.
> Each element able to move, to stir, to oscillate, to come and go in its relationships with the other elements in its universe.
> It must not be just a fleeting moment but a physical bond between the varying events in life.
> Not extractions,
> But abstractions
> Abstractions that are like nothing in life except in their manner of reacting.

> Alexander Calder
> from Abstraction-Cr√©ation, 1932

Inspired by [Alexander Calder's](https://calder.org/) Mobility series of sculptures. I designed this cover for Derya Sever's PhD thesis. Concept design is by Derya Sever.
