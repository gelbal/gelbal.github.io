excerpt: "An older post that is not tagged as latest, demonstrating the filtering system for homepage content organization."

This is an older post that should not appear in the Latest section since it doesn't have the "latest" tag. This helps test the filtering logic.

## Testing Filtering

This post serves as a test case to ensure that only posts tagged with "latest" appear in the homepage Latest section, while other posts remain accessible through category pages and direct links.

The content management system should properly filter based on tags while maintaining all posts in the overall site structure.
