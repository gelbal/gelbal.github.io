[Here are the Python notebooks](https://github.com/gelbal/wordpress-blog-metadata-organizer) that illustrate how I organized data.blog's taxonomy.

data.blog is a WordPress.com hosted blog. I organized taxonomy, by generating new tags and categories, and creating internal links between related posts using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

[I authored a blog post about this project on data.blog](https://data.blog/2025/03/21/organizing-data-blog-content-via-nlp-and-llm/).
