This poster's goal is to increase awareness on drying of lakes in Anatolia. The illustration is [Lake Tuz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tuz): Turkey's 2nd largest lake. More than 85% of it has dried up over the past century.

Part of on-going poster series. Subtle word plays on Turkish proverbs are used as poster slogans. I pick Turkey's current social issues as themes for each poster.

I heard the news in both national and international sites. Although well reported, these news do not convey the direness of the situation. I hope to show this with this illustration.
